### Welcome!
I had been telling myself for ages that I needed to find some time to put together a static page for myself. Very pleased at how much easier it was than I initially expected. Hosted on GitHub Pages and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), I can use Markdown to author whatever is on my mind (big thanks to Jonathan McGlone and his [fantastic walkthrough]([http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/])).

Check out my [about me](./about) to find out who I am and why I do what I do!
